NEW: ADDED BETA VERSION FOR COLOR DIS IN COLOR_DIS_BETA BRANCH


````


```bash
ddp_protocol.py and dis_service.py are compatible with all cluster versions in the COLOR_DIS_BETA branch.
To use dis_display.py with color DIS, add to config.json  "dis_type": "color"
The dis_display.py in COLOR_DIS_BETA is at the moment only compatible with color DIS clusters.
```
